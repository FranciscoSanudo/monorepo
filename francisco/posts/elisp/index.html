  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>I mentioned in the previous post that I stumbled into the world of Emacs almost accidentally. At the time, I didn&rsquo;t have a clear understanding of just how productive Emacs could be until I decided to dive in and give it a try. Initially, working with Emacs felt a bit awkward, and there were moments when I was tempted to give up. However, I persisted, driven by a curiosity to explore its capabilities, and I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly I adapted to this powerful text editor.</p>
<p>As I delved deeper into Emacs, I found myself needing to customize its configuration to suit my preferences. I was familiar with Vim and its configuration file (.vimrc), so I set out to find the Emacs equivalent. To my surprise, Emacs configuration was quite different, and it introduced me to a world filled with parentheses – Lisp, specifically Elisp. This was my first taste of Lisp programming, and it happened in late 2021. To this day, I&rsquo;m still amazed by the incredible versatility of Emacs.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s delve into the important aspects of working with Emacs, focusing on how to get started:</p>
<h2 id="emacs-configuration-is-lisp-code">Emacs Configuration is Lisp Code<a href="#emacs-configuration-is-lisp-code" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Emacs configuration files are written in Emacs Lisp (Elisp). This means that your <code>.emacs</code> or <code>init.el</code> file is essentially a Lisp program. You can customize every aspect of Emacs by writing Elisp code in this file. For example, to change the font size in your configuration, you&rsquo;d use Elisp like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(set-face-attribute <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;default</span> <span style="color:#66d9ef">nil</span> :height <span style="color:#ae81ff">120</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="using-elisp-for-simple-scenarios">Using Elisp for Simple Scenarios<a href="#using-elisp-for-simple-scenarios" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Emacs is extremely versatile, and Elisp allows you to create custom functionality. Here are some simple scenarios to get you started:</p>
<p><strong>Remove Menu Bar</strong>: If you want to hide the menu bar in Emacs, you can add the following line to your configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(menu-bar-mode <span style="color:#ae81ff">-1</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>Remove Scroll Bar</strong>: To get rid of the scroll bar, you can use this code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(scroll-bar-mode <span style="color:#ae81ff">-1</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>Start in a Specific Buffer</strong>: If you always want to start in a particular buffer, you can set it as the default buffer in your configuration. For example, to start in the Org Agenda buffer:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(setq initial-buffer-choice <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;org-agenda</span>)
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>Manage Packages</strong>: Emacs has a package manager, and you can use Elisp to install and configure packages. For example, to install the popular use-package package, add this to your configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-elisp" data-lang="elisp"><span style="display:flex;"><span>(require <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;package</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>(add-to-list <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;package-archives</span> <span style="color:#f92672">&#39;</span>(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;melpa&#34;</span> <span style="color:#f92672">.</span> <span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;https://melpa.org/packages/&#34;</span>) <span style="color:#66d9ef">t</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>(package-initialize)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>(unless (package-installed-p <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;use-package</span>)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (package-refresh-contents)
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>  (package-install <span style="color:#e6db74">&#39;use-package</span>))
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><strong>Basic File Manipulation/Navigation</strong>: Emacs provides powerful keybindings for file manipulation and navigation. For instance, C-x C-f opens a file, C-x C-s saves a file, and C-x C-w saves a file with a different name. You can also use C-x C-b to list buffers and switch between them.</p>
<p><strong>Programming</strong>: Emacs is a popular choice among programmers. You can use it for various programming languages with dedicated modes and extensions. For example, if you&rsquo;re working with Python, you can enable Python mode with M-x python-mode. You can also install language-specific packages like elpy for Python development or company-mode for autocompletion.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>In this journey of exploring Emacs and Elisp purely for the joy of learning, I can&rsquo;t help but wonder why this powerful tool isn&rsquo;t more widely recognized. As I continue this adventure, I&rsquo;m eager to experiment with Emacs in the realm of web technologies, inspired by success stories like &ldquo;Viaweb.&rdquo; A pioneering web application that continues to inspire me to this day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m keen to explore how Emacs can be a valuable tool in the ever-evolving world of web technologies. My next steps will likely look to play with Emacs integrations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I aim to investigate the integration of web browsers into the Emacs workflow using tools like eww (the Emacs Web Wowser). In doing so, I hope to unravel the untapped potential of Emacs in the ever-evolving world of web technologies and share my discoveries with those who share a similar curiosity and enthusiasm.</p>
