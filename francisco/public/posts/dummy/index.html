<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>I’ve been doing some light work in python, I’m aware that there is always better ways to do the things, my late days in elasticsearch support sounds actually calm and nice but you know I want to do better, to implement a good solution for the new business I’m working on.</p>
<p>Apart from operations and more focused on SRE light activities, I’ve decided to get to the next level, I noticed that Go was a trending thing, one of the most popular efficient languages for software engineers, and also claimed to be simple to learn and fast to create new projects. That was my choice for work, now we’re into the business.</p>
<p><a id="org7489392"></a></p>
<h1 id="the-plan-to-learn">The plan to learn</h1>
<p>First I need to master this thing enough to be desired by a company willing to hire a stranger in the business, so I’ll make a list thinking as I would do if I were in the other side of the table (if I were the person that would select the new hire)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Minimum requirements</p>
<p>Here I will list the minimum requirements that I’ve found for some jobs that are listed on linkedin.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>TODO go programming language knowledge</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>TODO paradigms</p>
<p>There are three paradigms</p>
<ul>
<li>Object oriented This uses classes and works mainly with data and go excels here because its lightweight, that means that handle data very efficient, better than other languages.</li>
<li>Imperative This is how descriptive is the series of steps needed to perform an operation.</li>
<li>Concurrent programming Multiple things done at the same time, my other better description would be that can use the same script multiple times with different data and all cpus in a very efficient way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>TODO constructs</p>
<p>A really cool website found here <a href="https://thedatasingh.medium.com/condition-construct-in-golang-f7f35aa60c5e">https://thedatasingh.medium.com/condition-construct-in-golang-f7f35aa60c5e</a> Basically what is states is that there are many ways to have conditional operations in golang, few of them not even seen in the past, lets try this out and write our notes.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If  Else</p>
<p>This is as expected, a series of if statments, the only thing you need to take care about is the syntaxis, this is different than python. Here is an example of a basic if else statement</p>
<pre><code>package main
import &quot;fmt&quot;

func main() {
	i := 7
	if i &gt; 10 {
		fmt.Println(&quot;Greater than 10&quot;)}
	else if i &gt; 5 {
		fmt.Println(&quot;Greater than 5&quot;)}
	else {
		fmt.Println(&quot;Less than 5&quot;)}
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just look at the way this is express the way that this differs from python is that a function is declared with (or not) parameters, then a bracket is open and the variables are declared or called. The most differnt part comes at the end of the if statment, instead of putting a ’:’ you put another open bracket like this ’{’, by doing this you’re going deeper in your logical. Other thing that you’ll notice is that there is no ’elif’ here, instead type completely the words ’else if’ to evaluate this statement. Kind of cool to see that there are no big major issues right? specially for someone coming from iables (dx) or time variable (dt). Here is a look of the code written this way.</p>
<pre><code>package main
import &quot;fmt&quot;

func main() {
	j := 2
	switch {
	case j &lt; 5:
		fmt.Println(&quot;one&quot;)
	case j &gt; 5:
		fmt.Println(&quot;two&quot;)
	case j == 5:
		fmt.Println(&quot;three&quot;)}}
</code></pre>
<p>It is cool to think about this as a system of differential equations. dx/dt = … dy/dt = … dz/dt = … And an analogy of this is the panel control in a chemical plant, where you can see the scada and the oeprator can manipulate the variables to control the process when the automation system does not work as expected. Chances of building new things are insane, I don’t even realize how much because is beyond my capacity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>TODO idioms I’ve found something very cool in the go official documentation <a href="https://go.dev/doc/effective_go">https://go.dev/doc/effective_go</a> I immediately noticed a disclaimer that this is written years ago and it is not intended to change. For me it imediately communicates that the way the code is done its designed to not change.</p>

<p>Its pretty easy to execute commands from terminal by using an script, of course this is only for proof of concept, having that in mind this is an excellent approach when you’re prototyping a project. There are times when we have no choice than keeping things going and a simple solution can make a big difference.</p>
<pre><code>package main
// This piece of code is pretty straight forward but there is now way to
import (
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    &quot;log&quot;
    &quot;os/exec&quot;
)

func main() {
    out, err := exec.Command(&quot;ls&quot;,&quot;-asl&quot;, &quot;../&quot;).Output()
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    // fmt.Printf(&quot;The date is %s\n&quot;, out)
    fmt.Printf(string(out))
}
</code></pre>
<p>Man, this is where I think that emacs excels, you can link anything inside of orgmode and also create scripts and call them up if needed, giving as an option a powerful control panel for daily operations that require any kind of automation.</p>
<p>Just think about it, any kind of daily scans, automation and other possibilities to make your job even easier are endless</p>
<p><a id="org0cfaab1"></a></p>
<h3 id="todo-parse-commands-output-in-go">TODO Parse commands output in go</h3>
<p>The idea here is to have more traction when it comes to data consumption, here what I would like to do is a simple parsing for unstructured data and then encoding it in a way that can be manipulated in the way we want.</p>
<p>Here we are going to start with simple log parsing and then the difficulty level will be increased, but why more complicated? you might ask, that might not require any further work if simple parse is what we want. Well the answer is really straightforward there is a full advantage here because we can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Filter out relevant logs from the rest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take actions based on certain logs behaviour such as</p>
<ul>
<li>Recommending the user to send an email</li>
<li>To count the number of events or even</li>
<li>To let the user know that there is a high possibility of FP based on XYZ.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Sky is the limit here, and now if you have the right tools you can pretty much do anything fast and simple with this wonderful language, lets start with the simple model.</p>
<pre><code>package main

import (
  &quot;fmt&quot;
  &quot;regexp&quot;
)

func main() {
  // a line of log
  logsExample := `[2021-08-27T07:39:54.173Z] &quot;GET /healthz HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 - 0 61 225 - &quot;111.114.195.106,10.0.0.11&quot; &quot;okhttp/3.12.1&quot; &quot;0557b0bd-4c1c-4c7a-ab7f-2120d67bee2f&quot; &quot;example.com&quot; &quot;172.16.0.1:8080&quot;`

  // your defined log format
  logsFormat := `\[$time_stamp\] \&quot;$http_method $request_path $_\&quot; $response_code - $_ $_ $_ - \&quot;$ips\&quot; \&quot;$_\&quot; \&quot;$_\&quot; \&quot;$_\&quot; \&quot;$_\&quot;`

  // transform all the defined variable into a regex-readable named format
  regexFormat := regexp.MustCompile(`\$([\w_]*)`).ReplaceAllString(logsFormat, `(?P&lt;$1&gt;.*)`)

  // compile the result
  re := regexp.MustCompile(regexFormat)

  // find all the matched data from the logsExample
  matches := re.FindStringSubmatch(logsExample)

  for i, k := range re.SubexpNames() {
    // ignore the first and the $_
    if i == 0 || k == &quot;_&quot; {
      continue
    }

    // print the defined variable
    fmt.Printf(&quot;%-15s =&gt; %s\n&quot;, k, matches[i])
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, its easy to catch the example showed above, this is something that will be fully used when the position is the same, in other words that the logs don’t change to much, that is the basic idea of the regex shown below. Of course there are more complex and exact ways to use regex to have a better accuracy on the relevant data, but for now the idea will be to keep it simple and make the assumption that will make the same every single time we are using Go.</p>
<p>Now, lets take another approach, we can simply ’scan’ a document in this case a log file and search for target words or any other particular regex pattern that can have a meaning, this is another powerful approach in this case for alerting.</p>
<pre><code>package main

import (
    &quot;bufio&quot;
    &quot;fmt&quot;
    &quot;os&quot;
    &quot;strings&quot;
)

func main() {
    request := 0
    f, err := os.Open(&quot;request.log&quot;)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Print(&quot;There has been an error!: &quot;, err)
    }
    defer f.Close()
    scanner := bufio.NewScanner(f)

    for scanner.Scan() {
        if strings.Contains(scanner.Text(), &quot;REQUEST-A&quot;) {
            request = request + 1
        }

        if err := scanner.Err(); err != nil {
        }
        fmt.Println(request)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see there are many areas where golang can be used, the next thing that will be discussed will be how to load such new matches or selected data into a socket connection.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see that there are full prepared libraries to connect with kafka and to retrieve information directly from there, this might be called as an optimization activity, no matter if it uses any third party as a source, but this time there will be more research of the current language and their applications in the company.</p>
