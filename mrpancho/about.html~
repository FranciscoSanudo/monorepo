<h1 class="title">About me</h1>
<p>
I will talk about me with heavy focus on the many interactions I've had in my journey during all this years, I've started back in 2012 when a group of workmates were using exclusevily apple computers and they constantly were making fun of windows machines. I was sick at that point of my windows pc and I was given the opportunity to try linux at work <i>(important to mention that this was not job tech related thing)</i> so I immediately installed ubuntu 12.04 on a thinkpad mahcine, since then I felt in love with Linux.
</p>

<p>
To complement my Linux expertise, I delved into scripting with Python and Bash. These languages became my go-to tools for automating tasks, enhancing productivity, and streamlining workflows. I leveraged Python to build scripts that facilitated data processing, system monitoring, and log analysis. Bash, on the other hand, empowered me to create efficient shell scripts for system administration and automation tasks.
</p>

<p>
It was during this phase of my journey that I discovered Emacs—a versatile text editor that aligned perfectly with my passion for customization and efficiency. I explored Emacs extensively, learning its intricate functionalities, and tailoring it to suit my programming needs. Emacs became my trusted companion, providing a rich environment for code creation, debugging, and version control.
</p>

<p>
As my skills evolved, I sought to apply my expertise in a professional setting. This led me to discover the power of the ELK stack—Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana—which presented an exciting opportunity to merge my knowledge of scripting and Linux with a cutting-edge data analytics and visualization platform.
</p>

<p>
With the ELK stack, I harnessed Elasticsearch's distributed search and analytics engine, Logstash's robust log ingestion and parsing capabilities, and Kibana's intuitive data visualization tools. As a result, I was able to develop scalable solutions for log analysis, monitoring, and data exploration.
</p>

<p>
Here's where my passion for Emacs truly shone. I seamlessly integrated Emacs with ELK, using its extensive package ecosystem to enhance my workflow and increase productivity. I leveraged Emacs' editing features, such as code completion and navigation, to efficiently analyze and transform data. Additionally, I customized Emacs to incorporate ELK-specific shortcuts and keybindings, allowing me to perform common tasks with ease.
</p>

<p>
In one notable project, I was part of a team responsible for implementing a real-time log analysis system. Utilizing my Linux skills, I optimized the underlying server infrastructure to handle the significant log volume efficiently. Leveraging Python and Bash, I developed data processing scripts that extracted valuable insights from raw logs and fed them into Elasticsearch via Logstash. With Kibana, I created visually compelling dashboards and reports that empowered stakeholders to make informed business decisions.
