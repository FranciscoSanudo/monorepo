<p>I&rsquo;m curious engineer with participation in multiple engineering disciplines from chemistry in manufacturing industry with major contribution in design and implementations for advanced industrial control systems where chemical unit operation design and logic were crucial for day to day operations. This eventually ignited my interest into learning more about computing technology, I still cannot believe that I&rsquo;ve made this far by deciding to start using Linux and later learning Python, so grateful these free gifts exist.</p>
<p>During this journey, there was a lot of self commitment and discipline, since I enjoyed learning solo, being a self taught practitioner in this field has given me the freedom to decide how much effort to use and when to use them as necessary.</p>
<p>I like experimenting with different technology areas which includes paths related to:</p>
<!-- Since I'm a person that is tries to experiments and sit wherever I find something interesting, right now I'm having into my head to pay close attention to next paths: -->
<ul>
<li>Data engineering / Data visualization and analysis</li>
<li>Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) / (DevOps)</li>
</ul>
<p>My personal choice for work is Python, but still have interest for new languages, right now I&rsquo;m experimenting with the languages trying to know more, I would like to see what are they used for, what is the are where they shine and how does this compare to others, what makes it so special, is this something I&rsquo;m going to use?.</p>
<ul>
<li>Golang</li>
<li>Clojure (and any other from lisp family)</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be material like that in this website.</p>
